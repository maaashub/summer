            <h3>Lesson Notes: What is Programming? 🤖</h3>
            <p>Welcome, young innovators! Over the next 30 days, we're going on an amazing adventure to learn how to create with computers and even make robots move!</p>
            <p>So, what is programming? Think of it like giving instructions to a computer. Just like you tell a friend what to do, programmers tell computers what to do, step-by-step. These instructions are called "code," and the process is called "coding" or "programming."</p>
            <p>Computers are super fast, but they only do exactly what you tell them. If your instructions aren't clear, the computer might get confused! Our goal is to learn how to give clear, precise instructions. 💡</p>

            <h3>Introducing Scratch! 🎨</h3>
            <p>Today, we're starting with a super fun and easy way to learn programming called <strong>Scratch</strong>. Scratch uses colorful blocks that you can snap together, just like LEGOs, to create stories, games, and animations. You don't need to type any complicated words! 🧩</p>
            <p><strong>Key Areas of the Scratch Interface:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">🎭</span> <strong>Stage:</strong> Where your project comes to life! You'll see your characters (called Sprites) here.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🐱</span> <strong>Sprites:</strong> The characters or objects in your project. You can choose from a library or draw your own.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🖼️</span> <strong>Backdrop:</strong> The background of your stage.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🧱</span> <strong>Blocks Palette:</strong> This is where all the colorful code blocks are organized by category (Motion, Looks, Sound, Events, Control, Sensing, Operators, Variables, My Blocks).</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">📝</span> <strong>Scripts Area:</strong> This is where you drag and drop blocks to build your code!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Sprites Move and Look Different! 🤸‍♀️</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Motion and Looks 🚶‍♀️👗</h3>
            <p>Yesterday, we got a taste of Scratch. Today, we'll dive deeper into two very important categories of blocks: <strong>Motion</strong> and <strong>Looks</strong>. ✨</p>

            <h4>Motion Blocks (Blue) 🔵</h4>
            <p>These blocks control how your sprites move on the Stage. 🗺️</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>move (10) steps</code>: Moves the sprite forward in the direction it's facing. ➡️</li>
                <li><code>turn (15) degrees</code>: Rotates the sprite clockwise or counter-clockwise. 🔄</li>
                <li><code>go to x: () y: ()</code>: Moves the sprite to a specific spot on the stage (coordinates). 📍</li>
                <li><code>glide (1) secs to x: () y: ()</code>: Makes the sprite smoothly move to a spot over a period of time. 🕊️</li>
                <li><code>if on edge, bounce</code>: If the sprite hits the edge of the stage, it will turn around. ↩️</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The Stage has an X-Y grid! X goes left-right, Y goes up-down. (0,0) is the very center. ➕</p>

            <h4>Looks Blocks (Purple) 🟣</h4>
            <p>These blocks change how your sprites appear on the Stage. 👀</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>say (Hello!) for (2) seconds</code>: Makes the sprite show a speech bubble. 💬</li>
                <li><code>think (Hmm...) for (2) seconds</code>: Makes the sprite show a thought bubble. 💭</li>
                <li><code>switch costume to (costume2)</code>: Changes the sprite's appearance. Sprites can have multiple "costumes." 👗</li>
                <li><code>next costume</code>: Switches to the next costume in the list. ➡️</li>
                <li><code>change size by (10)</code> / <code>set size to (100)%</code>: Makes the sprite bigger or smaller. 📏</li>
                <li><code>hide</code> / <code>show</code>: Makes the sprite disappear or reappear. 👻</li>
                <li><code>change color effect by (25)</code> / <code>clear graphic effects</code>: Adds cool visual effects. 🌈</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Sprite Dance Party 💃🕺</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In small groups (3-4), brainstorm an idea for a "dance" or "show" using 2-3 sprites. Each group member takes responsibility for one sprite. Work together to make your sprites move and change costumes in a coordinated way. 👯‍♀️</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Practice using Motion and Looks blocks collaboratively and understand basic coordination. 🤝</p>

                    <li>Make the ball start at the bottom of the screen (e.g., <code>go to x: 0 y: -150</code>). ⬇️</li>
                    <li>Make the ball glide up to the top (e.g., <code>glide 1 secs to x: 0 y: 150</code>). ⬆️</li>
                    <li>Then, make it glide back down (e.g., <code>glide 1 secs to x: 0 y: -150</code>). ⬇️</li>
                    <li>Repeat this motion forever (we'll learn the "forever" block tomorrow!). For now, just make it go up and down once. 🔁</li>
                    <li>Add a "change color effect by 25" block each time it goes up or down. 🎨</li>

            <div class="day-header">Day 3: Events & Control Blocks</div>
            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Your Projects Interactive! 🎮</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Events and Control 🚦</h3>
            <p>So far, our Scratch projects have started automatically or when we click individual blocks. Today, we'll learn how to make them interactive and control when things happen using <strong>Events</strong> and <strong>Control</strong> blocks. 🕹️</p>

            <h4>Events Blocks (Yellow) 🟡</h4>
            <p>Events are like triggers that start your code. They tell your program "when to do something." ⏰</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>when green flag clicked</code>: The most common way to start a project. ▶️</li>
                <li><code>when (space) key pressed</code>: Starts code when a specific key is pressed. ⌨️</li>
                <li><code>when this sprite clicked</code>: Starts code when you click on the sprite. 👆</li>
                <li><code>when backdrop switches to (backdrop1)</code>: Starts code when the background changes. 🏞️➡️🌃</li>
                <li><code>when I receive (message1)</code> / <code>broadcast (message1)</code>: These are super important for sprites to talk to each other! (More on this later). 📡</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Control Blocks (Orange) 🟠</h4>
            <p>Control blocks manage the flow of your program. They tell your code "how many times" or "under what conditions" to do something. ⚙️</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>wait (1) seconds</code>: Pauses your program for a specified time. ⏳</li>
                <li><code>repeat (10)</code>: Repeats the blocks inside it a certain number of times. 🔄</li>
                <li><code>forever</code>: Repeats the blocks inside it endlessly. This is great for continuous animations or games. ♾️</li>
                <li><code>if () then</code>: Performs actions ONLY if a certain condition is true. (We'll use Sensing blocks with this). ✅</li>
                <li><code>if () then else</code>: Performs one set of actions if a condition is true, and a different set if it's false. ⚖️</li>
                <li><code>stop all</code>: Stops all scripts in the project. 🛑</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Think of "Events" as the "start" button for a specific part of your code, and "Control" blocks as the rules for how that code runs. 🧠</p>

            <div class="peer-learning-box">
                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Interactive Storytelling 📖🤝</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In pairs, create a short interactive story in Scratch. One person focuses on the "Events" (e.g., when green flag clicked, when space key pressed, when sprite clicked), and the other focuses on "Control" (e.g., repeat, forever, wait). Make a character move, then stop and say something when you press a key, and then maybe change its costume repeatedly. 🗣️🔄</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand how Events trigger actions and Control blocks manage the timing and repetition of those actions. 🎯</p>

            <div class="day-header">Day 4: Loops & Conditionals</div>
            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Smart Decisions & Repeating Actions! 🧠🔄</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Loops and Conditionals 🔁❓</h3>
            <p>Today, we're focusing on two powerful concepts from the <strong>Control</strong> category: <strong>Loops</strong> and <strong>Conditionals</strong>. These are fundamental to all programming, not just Scratch! 💪</p>

            <h4>Loops (Repetition) 🔄</h4>
            <p>Loops allow you to repeat a set of instructions without having to write them over and over again. This saves a lot of time and makes your code much cleaner. 🧹</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>repeat (10)</code>: Executes the blocks inside exactly 10 times (or whatever number you put). 🔢</li>
                <li><code>forever</code>: Executes the blocks inside endlessly. Great for game loops, animations, or constantly checking something. ♾️</li>
                <li><code>repeat until ()</code>: Executes the blocks inside until a certain condition becomes true. (We'll use Sensing blocks here). ✅</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are loops important?</strong> Imagine making a character walk 100 steps. Instead of dragging 100 "move 1 step" blocks, you just use one "move 1 step" inside a "repeat 100" loop! 🚶‍♂️💨</p>

            <h4>Conditionals (Decision Making) ⚖️</h4>
            <p>Conditionals allow your program to make decisions. They say, "If something is true, then do this; otherwise, maybe do something else." 🤔</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>if () then</code>: If the condition inside the hexagon shape is true, the blocks inside this C-shaped block will run. If false, they are skipped. ✅❌</li>
                <li><code>if () then else</code>: If the condition is true, the blocks in the "then" part run. If the condition is false, the blocks in the "else" part run. ➡️⬅️</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How do we get the condition?</strong> We use <strong>Sensing</strong> blocks (light blue) and <strong>Operators</strong> blocks (green) inside the hexagonal input of the conditional blocks. 👁️‍🗨️➕</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensing Blocks:</strong> <code>touching (mouse-pointer)?</code>, <code>key (space) pressed?</code>, <code>distance to (mouse-pointer)</code>, <code>ask (What's your name?) and wait</code>. 📍⌨️📏💬</li>
                <li><strong>Operators Blocks:</strong> <code>() > ()</code> (greater than), <code>() < ()</code> (less than), <code>() = ()</code> (equal to), <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>. ➕➖✖️➗</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Loops are about "doing something many times." Conditionals are about "doing something only if a specific situation is true." Together, they make your programs smart and dynamic! 💡</p>

                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Obstacle Course Game Design 🚧🤝</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In pairs, design a simple obstacle course game. One person focuses on making an obstacle move repeatedly (using a loop). The other focuses on what happens if the player touches the obstacle (using an <code>if then</code> conditional and a Sensing block like <code>touching (obstacle sprite)?</code>). 🏃‍♂️💥</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Apply loops for continuous action and conditionals for interaction/collision detection. 🎯</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Keeping Score and Doing Math! 💯➕</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Variables and Operators 📦🧮</h3>
            <p>Today, we'll learn how to make our games keep track of information, like scores or health, using <strong>Variables</strong>. We'll also explore <strong>Operators</strong>, which help us do math and compare things. 📊</p>

            <h4>Variables (Orange/Data) 🟠</h4>
            <p>A variable is like a special box or container where you can store a piece of information (a number, some text, etc.). The value inside the box can change! In Scratch, you create variables in the "Variables" category. 🗃️</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>make a variable</code>: Creates a new variable. You can choose if it's "for all sprites" (everyone can see it) or "for this sprite only." 🌐👤</li>
                <li><code>set (my variable) to (0)</code>: Puts a specific value into the variable. ➡️</li>
                <li><code>change (my variable) by (1)</code>: Adds or subtracts a value from the variable's current value. ⬆️⬇️</li>
                <li><code>show variable (my variable)</code> / <code>hide variable (my variable)</code>: Shows or hides the variable's display on the Stage. 🙈🙉</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong> Scores, health, lives, timers, speed, names. 🏆❤️⏰💨</p>

            <h4>Operators (Green) 🟢</h4>
            <p>Operators are like tools for doing math, comparing values, and combining text. They often fit into the hexagonal or oval-shaped inputs of other blocks. 🛠️</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Math Operators:</strong> <code>() + ()</code>, <code>() - ()</code>, <code>() * ()</code>, <code>() / ()</code> (add, subtract, multiply, divide). ➕➖✖️➗</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> <code>() > ()</code> (greater than), <code>() < ()</code> (less than), <code>() = ()</code> (equal to). These return TRUE or FALSE, perfect for conditional blocks! 📏✅❌</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> <code>() and ()</code>, <code>() or ()</code>, <code>not ()</code>. Combine or invert true/false conditions.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>and</code>: Both conditions must be true. ✅✅</li>
                        <li><code>or</code>: At least one condition must be true. ✅❌ or ❌✅</li>
                        <li><code>not</code>: Reverses the condition (true becomes false, false becomes true). 🔄</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>String Operators:</strong> <code>join (apple) (banana)</code> (combines text), <code>letter (1) of (apple)</code>. 🔗🔤</li>
                <li><strong>Random Number:</strong> <code>pick random (1) to (10)</code>: Generates a random number within a range. Very useful for games! 🎲</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Variables store the data, and Operators help you manipulate that data (change scores, check if a score is high enough, etc.). 🤝</p>

                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Scoreboard Design 🏆🤝</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In pairs, brainstorm a game idea where keeping score is important. Discuss: What variable(s) would you need? When would the score change (increase/decrease)? What operators might you use (e.g., to check if the score reaches a winning number)? Draw a simple sketch of your game screen with the scoreboard. ✍️</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand the purpose of variables and how operators help manage game logic. 🎯</p>

            <div class="day-header">Day 6: Broadcasts & Messages</div>
            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Sprites Talk to Each Other! 🗣️📡</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Broadcasts and Messages 📻</h3>
            <p>So far, our sprites have mostly acted independently or reacted to direct interaction. Today, we'll learn a super important way for sprites to communicate and coordinate actions: <strong>Broadcasts and Messages</strong>. 📬</p>

            <h4>Broadcast Blocks (Yellow - Events Category) 🟡</h4>
            <p>Think of broadcasting like sending a message to everyone on the stage. Any sprite can send a message, and any sprite can listen for a message. 📢</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>broadcast (message1)</code>: Sends a message to all other sprites and the stage. The script that sends this message continues running immediately. 🚀</li>
                <li><code>broadcast (message1) and wait</code>: Sends a message and then pauses the current script until all other scripts that are listening for that message have finished running. ⏳</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>When I Receive Block (Yellow - Events Category) 🟡</h4>
            <p>This block is the listener. When a sprite receives a specific message that has been broadcast, the code attached to this block will start running. 👂</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>when I receive (message1)</code>: When this sprite gets 'message1', start running the blocks attached. ▶️</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are they important?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Make multiple sprites do things at the same time or in a specific sequence (e.g., "Game Start" message makes all enemies appear). 👯‍♀️</li>
                <li><strong>Scene Changes:</strong> When one scene ends, broadcast a message like "Next Level" to switch backdrops and set up new sprites. 🏞️➡️🌃</li>
                <li><strong>Complex Interactions:</strong> A player sprite might broadcast "Hit Enemy" which the enemy sprite listens for to decrease its health. 💥❤️‍🩹</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Broadcasts are like a radio station. One sprite sends a signal (broadcast), and other sprites tune into that signal (when I receive) to react. This is a fundamental concept for making complex, multi-part programs work together. 🌐</p>

            <div class="peer-learning-box">
                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Collaborative Story Scene 📖🤝</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In groups of 3, plan a short scene for a story or game where at least two sprites need to react to something one sprite does. For example: 🎭</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sprite A says "Hello!" and then broadcasts "greeting". 💬📢</li>
                    <li>Sprite B, when it receives "greeting", waves. 👋</li>
                    <li>Sprite C, when it receives "greeting", changes color. 🌈</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Work together to implement this in Scratch. 🧩</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Practice using broadcast/receive to synchronize actions between sprites. 🎯</p>

            <div class="day-header">Day 8: Functions (My Blocks) & Code Organization</div>
            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Reusable Code with "My Blocks" 🧱🔄</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Functions and Modularity 🧩</h3>
            <p>As our Scratch projects get bigger, our code can get long and messy. Today, we'll learn about <strong>"My Blocks"</strong> (also known as Functions or Procedures in other programming languages). These help us organize our code and make it reusable! 🧹</p>

            <h4>What are "My Blocks"? 📦</h4>
            <p>A "My Block" is like creating your own custom block that contains a sequence of other blocks. Instead of repeating the same set of instructions many times, you can just call your custom block. 📞</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Define Block:</strong> This is where you put the actual code that your custom block will run. It starts with <code>define [My Block Name]</code>. ⚙️</li>
                <li><strong>Call Block:</strong> This is the new block that appears in your "My Blocks" category. When you drag this block into your script, it runs all the code defined inside its "Define" block. ▶️</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why use "My Blocks" (Functions)?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Makes your scripts shorter and easier to read. 📚</li>
                <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Write a set of instructions once, and use it many times in different places. ♻️</li>
                <li><strong>Easier Debugging:</strong> If there's a bug in a repeated action, you only need to fix it in one place (the "Define" block). 🐞🩹</li>
                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> You don't need to know *how* the block works, just *what* it does. (e.g., you use "move 10 steps" without knowing the complex math behind it). 🎩✨</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Adding Inputs to "My Blocks" ➡️</h4>
            <p>You can make your custom blocks even more powerful by adding inputs (parameters/arguments). This allows you to pass different values to your block each time you use it. 🔢🔤</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you create a new "My Block," you can add a "number or text input" or a "boolean input" (for true/false conditions). ✅❌</li>
                <li>These inputs become variables within your "Define" block. 📦</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> "My Blocks" are your first step into understanding "functions" in text-based programming. Functions are essential for breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, which is a core concept in computer science. 🧠</p>

            <div class="peer-learning-box">
                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Function Brainstorm 🧠💡</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In pairs, look at your mini-project from Day 7. Identify any sequences of blocks that you repeated, or that perform a clear, single task (e.g., "make character jump," "reset game," "play winning animation"). Discuss how you could turn these into "My Blocks." 🔄</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Recognize patterns in code that can be abstracted into functions. 🎯</p>

                    <li>Go to "My Blocks" and click "Make a Block." 🆕</li>
                    <li>Name it <code>move steps and turn</code>. 🏷️</li>
                    <li>Add two number/text inputs: <code>steps</code> and <code>degrees</code>. 🔢</li>
                    <li>In the <code>define move steps and turn (steps) (degrees)</code> block, add:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>move (steps) steps</code> ➡️</li>
                            <li><code>turn (degrees) degrees</code> 🔄</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, in your main script (e.g., <code>when green flag clicked</code>), drag your new <code>move steps and turn</code> block. Try different values for steps and degrees. 🧪</li>
                    <li>Challenge: Create another "My Block" called <code>grow and shrink</code> that takes a <code>size change</code> input and makes the sprite grow and then shrink by that amount. 🌳🍄</li>

            <div class="day-header">Day 9: Lists (Arrays)</div>
            <h2 class="slide-title">Storing Collections of Data! 📚</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Lists (Arrays) 📋</h3>
            <p>So far, variables can only hold one piece of information at a time. What if we want to store a whole collection of things, like a list of favorite foods, high scores, or items in a game inventory? That's where <strong>Lists</strong> come in! 🛒</p>

            <h4>What are Lists? 📝</h4>
            <p>In Scratch, a List (in other programming languages, often called an "Array") is like a container that can hold many different items, one after another, in a specific order. Each item has a number (its "index") that tells you its position in the list. 🔢</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make a List:</strong> Found in the "Variables" category, just like making a variable. 🆕</li>
                <li><strong>Add Item:</strong> <code>add (thing) to (my list)</code>: Adds a new item to the end of the list. ➕</li>
                <li><strong>Delete Item:</strong> <code>delete (1) of (my list)</code>: Removes an item at a specific position (index). 🗑️</li>
                <li><strong>Insert Item:</strong> <code>insert (thing) at (1) of (my list)</code>: Adds an item at a specific position, pushing other items down. ➡️</li>
                <li><strong>Replace Item:</strong> <code>replace item (1) of (my list) with (thing)</code>: Changes an item at a specific position. 🔄</li>
                <li><strong>Get Item:</strong> <code>item (1) of (my list)</code>: Gets the item at a specific position. 🔍</li>
                <li><strong>Length:</strong> <code>length of (my list)</code>: Tells you how many items are in the list. 📏</li>
                <li><strong>Contains:</strong> <code>(my list) contains (thing)?</code>: Checks if an item is in the list (returns true/false). ✅❌</li>
                <li><code>show list (my list)</code> / <code>hide list (my list)</code>: Shows or hides the list display on the Stage. 🙈🙉</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> In Scratch, list items are numbered starting from 1. In many text-based languages, they start from 0! ⚠️</p>
            <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing high scores. 🏆</li>
                <li>Managing inventory in a game (e.g., items collected). 🎒</li>
                <li>Creating quizzes with multiple questions. ❓</li>
                <li>Storing dialogue lines for characters. 💬</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Lists are crucial for handling collections of data. This concept directly translates to "arrays" or "lists" in C and other languages. Understanding how to add, remove, and access items in a list is a fundamental programming skill. 🧠</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Thinking Like a Programmer: Step-by-Step Solutions! 🧠🪜</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: What are Algorithms? ⚙️</h3>
            <p>Before we write any code, whether in Scratch or C, we need a plan! Today, we'll learn about <strong>Algorithms</strong> and how to visualize them using <strong>Flowcharts</strong>. 🗺️</p>

            <h4>What is an Algorithm? 🤔</h4>
            <p>An algorithm is simply a step-by-step set of instructions or rules for solving a problem or completing a task. Think of it like a recipe for baking a cake, or directions to get to a friend's house. Every program you've made in Scratch so far is an algorithm! 🍰➡️🏠</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear:</strong> Each step must be unambiguous. 🔍</li>
                <li><strong>Finite:</strong> It must end after a certain number of steps. 🛑</li>
                <li><strong>Effective:</strong> It must solve the problem. ✅</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Examples of Algorithms in Daily Life:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to brush your teeth. 🦷</li>
                <li>How to make a cup of tea. ☕</li>
                <li>How to find a book in a library. 📚</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What are Flowcharts? 📊</h4>
            <p>A flowchart is a diagram that shows the steps of an algorithm using special shapes and arrows. It helps us visualize the logic and flow of a program before we start coding. ✍️</p>
            <p><strong>Common Flowchart Symbols:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">⚪</span> <strong>Oval (Start/End):</strong> Marks the beginning or end of the algorithm.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji"> прямоугольник</span> <strong>Rectangle (Process/Action):</strong> Represents a step where something is done (e.g., "Move 10 steps," "Change score by 1").</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">菱形</span> <strong>Diamond (Decision):</strong> Represents a point where a decision is made, usually a "Yes/No" or "True/False" question (e.g., "Is touching edge?"). There are usually two paths coming out.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">平行四边形</span> <strong>Parallelogram (Input/Output):</strong> Represents data being entered into the system (input) or displayed (output) (e.g., "Ask name," "Say Hello!").</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">➡️</span> <strong>Arrows (Flow Lines):</strong> Show the direction of the flow from one step to another.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Understanding algorithms and flowcharts is super important because it helps you think logically and break down big problems into smaller, manageable steps. This skill is essential for any kind of programming, whether visual or text-based, and even for designing robotics logic. 🧠</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Translating Blocks to Code: The Power of C! 💻</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Scratch Concepts in C</h3>
            <p>You've become Scratch masters! Now, let's see how the amazing concepts you've learned in Scratch translate into a foundational text-based programming language called <strong>C</strong>. C is a very powerful language that gives you a lot of control over the computer, and it's used in many places, including operating systems, games, and even microcontrollers! Learning C first will help you truly appreciate how much easier other languages like Python make things later. 😉</p>

            <h4>Why C? 🚀</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Foundation:</strong> C teaches you how computers work at a more fundamental level.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> C programs can be very fast!</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> It gives you fine-grained control over hardware, which is great for robotics.</li>
                <li><strong>Stepping Stone:</strong> Understanding C makes it easier to learn other languages, including Python and C++.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Your First C Program: "Hello, World!" 👋</h4>
            <p>Every programmer starts with "Hello, World!". In C, it looks like this:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // This line includes a library for input/output functions

int main() { // The 'main' function is where your program starts running
    printf("Hello, World!\n"); // printf is like Scratch's 'say' block
    return 0; // Means the program finished successfully
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>#include <stdio.h></code>: This line tells the C compiler to include the "Standard Input/Output" library, which contains functions like <code>printf</code>. Think of it like adding an "extension" in Scratch.</li>
                <li><code>int main() { ... }</code>: This is the main function where your program begins execution. All your code will go inside the curly braces <code>{}</code>. It's like the "when green flag clicked" block in Scratch, but for your whole program.</li>
                <li><code>printf("Hello, World!\n");</code>: This is how you print text to the console. <code>\n</code> means "new line" (like pressing Enter).</li>
                <li><code>return 0;</code>: This tells the operating system that your program ran without any errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Every C statement must end with a semicolon <code>;</code>!</p>

            <h4>Comments in C 📝</h4>
            <p>Comments are notes in your code that the C compiler ignores. They are for humans to read and understand what the code does.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>// This is a single-line comment.

/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across several lines.
*/
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> The fundamental idea of giving instructions, starting a program, and displaying output is the same as in Scratch. You're just using different words and symbols! 🧠➡️⌨️</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Storing Information and Doing Math in C! 📦➕</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Variables and Operators in C</h3>
            <p>Just like in Scratch, variables in C are containers for data. But in C, you have to tell the computer what *type* of data the variable will hold before you use it! This is called "declaring" a variable. 🧐</p>

            <h4>Variables and Data Types in C 📊</h4>
            <p>Before you use a variable in C, you must declare its type. Common types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>int</code>: For whole numbers (integers), like 5, -100, 0. 🔢</li>
                <li><code>float</code>: For numbers with decimal points, like 3.14, 0.5. decimals</li>
                <li><code>char</code>: For single characters, like 'A', 'b', '7'. (Use single quotes). 🔤</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Declaring and Assigning Variables:</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int score = 0; // Declare an integer variable named 'score' and set its value to 0
    float pi = 3.14159; // Declare a float variable named 'pi'
    char initial = 'C'; // Declare a character variable

    printf("Current score: %i\n", score); // %i is a placeholder for an integer
    printf("Value of Pi: %f\n", pi);     // %f is a placeholder for a float
    printf("My initial is: %c\n", initial); // %c is a placeholder for a character

    // Changing variable values
    score = score + 10; // Add 10 to score
    printf("New score: %i\n", score);

    score++; // Shortcut: add 1 to score (like 'change score by 1' in Scratch)
    printf("Score after increment: %i\n", score);

    pi = pi * 2; // Multiply pi by 2
    printf("Pi doubled: %f\n", pi);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Format Specifiers:</strong> When using <code>printf</code> to display variables, you need special placeholders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>%i</code> or <code>%i</code>: for <code>int</code> (decimal integer)</li>
                <li><code>%f</code>: for <code>float</code> (floating-point number)</li>
                <li><code>%c</code>: for <code>char</code> (character)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Basic Arithmetic Operators in C ➕➖✖️➗</h4>
            <p>C uses the same arithmetic operators you're familiar with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>+</code> : Addition</li>
                <li><code>-</code> : Subtraction</li>
                <li><code>*</code> : Multiplication</li>
                <li><code>/</code> : Division</li>
                <li><code>%</code> : Modulo (gives the remainder of a division)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int num1 = 20;
    int num2 = 7;

    printf("Sum: %i\n", num1 + num2);       // Output: 27
    printf("Difference: %i\n", num1 - num2); // Output: 13
    printf("Product: %i\n", num1 * num2);    // Output: 140
    printf("Quotient: %f\n", (float)num1 / num2); // Output: 2.857... (Need (float) for decimal division)
    printf("Remainder: %i\n", num1 % num2);  // Output: 6 (20 divided by 7 is 2 with remainder 6)

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Note on Division:</strong> If you divide two integers in C, the result will also be an integer (it throws away the decimal part). To get a decimal result, you need to convert one of the numbers to a <code>float</code> first, like <code>(float)num1 / num2</code>.</p>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Variables in C are like Scratch variables, but with strict data types. Arithmetic operators are the same concept as Scratch's green operator blocks. You're learning how to be very precise with your computer instructions! 🎯</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Making C Programs Interactive & Smart! 💬🤔</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: User Input and Decisions in C</h3>
            <p>Today, we'll learn how to get input from the user in C and how to make our programs make decisions based on that input. This is where your programs become truly interactive, just like your Scratch projects! 🎮</p>

            <h4>Getting Input from the User: `scanf()` ⌨️</h4>
            <p>The <code>scanf()</code> function reads input from the keyboard and stores it in a variable. It's like Scratch's "ask and wait" block!</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int age; // Declare an integer variable to store age
    float height; // Declare a float variable for height
    char initial; // Declare a character variable

    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%i", &age); // Read an integer from the keyboard and store it in 'age'

    printf("Enter your height in meters (e.g., 1.5): ");
    scanf("%f", &height); // Read a float

    printf("Enter the first letter of your name: ");
    scanf(" %c", &initial); // Read a character (note the space before %c!)

    printf("\nYou are %i years old, %.2f meters tall, and your initial is %c.\n", age, height, initial);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Address-of Operator (`&`):</strong> When using <code>scanf()</code>, you need to put an ampersand (`&`) before the variable name (e.g., `&age`). This tells `scanf` where in the computer's memory to store the input.</li>
                <li><strong>Format Specifiers:</strong> Just like with `printf()`, you need the correct format specifier (`%i`, `%f`, `%c`) to tell `scanf()` what type of data to expect.</li>
                <li><strong>Space before `%c`:</strong> When reading a `char` after reading numbers or other text, always put a space before `%c` in `scanf(" %c", &initial);`. This consumes any leftover newline characters from previous inputs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Making Decisions: `if`, `else if`, `else` ⚖️</h4>
            <p>C uses `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional logic, just like Scratch's `if () then` and `if () then else` blocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> Used inside `if` conditions to compare values.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>`==` : Equal to (<strong>two</strong> equals signs!)</li>
                <li>`!=` : Not equal to</li>
                <li>`>`  : Greater than</li>
                <li>`<`  : Less than</li>
                <li>`>=` : Greater than or equal to</li>
                <li>`<=` : Less than or equal to</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Used to combine multiple conditions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>`&&` : AND (both conditions must be true)</li>
                <li>`||` : OR (at least one condition must be true)</li>
                <li>`!`  : NOT (reverses the truth of a condition)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%i", &number);

    if (number > 0) { // If number is greater than 0
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
    } else if (number < 0) { // Else if number is less than 0
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    } else { // Else (if neither of the above is true, meaning number is 0)
        printf("The number is zero.\n");
    }

    // Example with logical operators
    int age;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%i", &age);

    if (age >= 7 && age <= 17) { // If age is 7 or more AND 17 or less
        printf("You are in the age range for this camp!\n");
    } else {
        printf("This camp is not for your age group.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Notice:</strong> C uses curly braces `{}` to group statements that belong to an `if`, `else if`, or `else` block. Indentation is for readability, but the braces are what matter to the compiler.</p>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> `scanf()` is your direct equivalent to Scratch's "ask and wait," allowing your program to get information from the user. `if/else` statements in C are the same decision-making tools as in Scratch, letting your program react differently based on conditions. You're building truly interactive programs! 🤝</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Repeating Actions in C! 🔄</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Loops in C</h3>
            <p>Just like Scratch's `repeat` and `forever` blocks, C has powerful ways to repeat code using <strong>loops</strong>. Loops are essential for doing repetitive tasks efficiently! 🔁</p>

            <h4>The `for` Loop 🔢</h4>
            <p>The `for` loop is great when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something. It's like Scratch's `repeat (10)` block.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    // This loop will print "Hello!" 5 times
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Hello! (Iteration %i)\n", i);
    }
    // i starts at 0.
    // The loop continues as long as i < 5.
    // i++ means i increases by 1 after each loop.

    printf("\nCounting down:\n");
    for (int count = 10; count > 0; count--) {
        printf("%i...\n", count);
    }
    printf("Blast off!\n");

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>`for` loop structure:</strong> `for (initialization; condition; update) { ... code ... }`</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Runs once at the beginning (e.g., `int i = 0;`).</li>
                <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Checked before each repetition. If true, the loop runs. If false, the loop stops (e.g., `i < 5;`).</li>
                <li><strong>Update:</strong> Runs after each repetition (e.g., `i++` which means `i = i + 1;`).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The `while` Loop ♾️</h4>
            <p>The `while` loop repeats as long as a certain condition is true. It's like Scratch's `forever` or `repeat until` blocks.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int counter = 0;
    while (counter < 3) { // Loop as long as counter is less than 3
        printf("Looping... Counter is %i\n", counter);
        counter++; // Important: remember to change the condition inside the loop!
    }

    printf("\nGuessing Game (simple version):\n");
    int secret_number = 7; // Imagine this is a random number
    int guess;

    while (guess != secret_number) { // Loop until the guess is correct
        printf("Guess the secret number (1-10): ");
        scanf("%i", &guess);
        if (guess != secret_number) {
            printf("Wrong guess! Try again.\n");
        }
    }
    printf("Congratulations! You guessed it: %i\n", secret_number);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>`while` loop structure:</strong> `while (condition) { ... code ... }`</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The `condition` is checked before each repetition. If true, the loop runs. If false, the loop stops.</li>
                <li><strong>Caution:</strong> If the condition never becomes false, you'll have an "infinite loop"! This is like Scratch's `forever` block.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> `for` and `while` loops in C directly implement the repetition logic you used with `repeat` and `forever` in Scratch. The `while` loop is particularly powerful for game loops or waiting for a sensor input, just like `forever` loops in Scratch constantly check for conditions. 🧠</p>

                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand when to use different types of loops.</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Bringing Code to the Real World! 🌍💻</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Intro to IoT and Robotics 🤖💡</h3>
            <p>You've learned to make programs on a computer screen. Now, let's explore how programming can interact with the physical world! Today, we introduce <strong>IoT (Internet of Things)</strong> and <strong>Robotics</strong>. 🌐</p>

            <h4>What is IoT (Internet of Things)? 🔗</h4>
            <p>IoT refers to physical objects ("things") embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These "things" can be anything from smart home devices to industrial machines. 🏠🏭</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Everyday objects connected to the internet, collecting and sharing data to make our lives easier or smarter. 🧠</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">💡</span> <strong>Smart Lights:</strong> Turn on/off with your phone, change color, or automatically adjust to daylight.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🌡️</span> <strong>Smart Thermostats:</strong> Learn your preferences and adjust temperature automatically, or let you control it remotely.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">⌚</span> <strong>Wearable Fitness Trackers:</strong> Monitor your heart rate, steps, sleep, and send data to your phone.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🧊</span> <strong>Smart Refrigerators:</strong> Tell you when you're low on milk!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How it connects to Programming:</strong> IoT devices need code to collect data from sensors, send it over the internet, and react to commands received from the internet. 💻➡️🌐</p>

            <h4>What is Robotics? 🤖</h4>
            <p>Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. Robots are machines that can perform tasks automatically, often mimicking human actions or performing tasks that are dangerous or repetitive for humans. 🦾</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Machines that can sense their environment, process information, and act on the physical world. 👁️‍🗨️🧠💪</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">🚗</span> <strong>Factory Robots:</strong> Assemble cars, move heavy objects.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🧹</span> <strong>Vacuum Cleaners (e.g., Roomba):</strong> Navigate your home and clean floors.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🩺</span> <strong>Surgical Robots:</strong> Assist doctors in delicate operations.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🪐</span> <strong>Exploration Rovers (e.g., Mars Rover):</strong> Explore distant planets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How it connects to Programming:</strong> Robots need code to tell them how to move, how to interpret sensor data (like seeing obstacles), and how to make decisions (like turning left or right). This is where our programming skills come in! 💻➡️🤖</p>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Both IoT and Robotics involve bridging the digital world of code with the physical world. They use sensors to gather information (like Scratch's "sensing" blocks), process that information (like Scratch's "control" and "operator" blocks, or C's `if/else` and arithmetic), and then perform actions (like Scratch's "motion" and "looks" blocks, but in the real world!). 🌉</p>

            <h4>What is a Microcontroller? 🧠</h4>
            <p>A microcontroller is like a tiny, simple computer on a single chip. It's designed to control specific tasks in electronic devices. Unlike the powerful computer you're using now (which can do many things at once), a microcontroller is usually dedicated to one or a few jobs very well. 🎯</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">The Building Blocks of Electronics! 🧱⚡</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Basic Electronics 🔌</h3>
            <p>Before we connect anything to our microcontrollers, we need to understand some basic electronics. Don't worry, we'll keep it simple and safe! Today, we'll learn about circuits, LEDs, and resistors. 💡🛡️</p>

            <h4>Electricity and Circuits ⚡🔄</h4>
            <p>Electricity is the flow of tiny particles called electrons. For electricity to do work (like lighting an LED), it needs a complete path, called a <strong>Circuit</strong>. 🛤️</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">🔋</span> <strong>Power Source:</strong> Provides the electricity (e.g., a battery, or our microcontroller). Has a positive (+) and negative (-) side.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">〰️</span> <strong>Conductors:</strong> Materials that allow electricity to flow easily (e.g., wires, copper).</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🚫</span> <strong>Insulators:</strong> Materials that block electricity (e.g., plastic, rubber).</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">💡</span> <strong>Load:</strong> The component that uses the electricity to do something (e.g., an LED, a motor).</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">✅</span> <strong>Closed Circuit:</strong> A complete loop where electricity can flow from the positive side of the power source, through the load, and back to the negative side.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">❌</span> <strong>Open Circuit:</strong> A broken path where electricity cannot flow.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) 💡</h4>
            <p>An LED is a special type of light bulb that uses very little power. It has two "legs" or "leads":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">➕</span> <strong>Anode (+):</strong> The longer leg, connects to the positive side of the circuit.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">➖</span> <strong>Cathode (-):</strong> The shorter leg, connects to the negative side (ground).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> LEDs only work if electricity flows in the correct direction! And they need a resistor to protect them. ⚠️</p>

            <h4>Resistors 🛡️</h4>
            <p>A resistor is a component that <strong>resists</strong> the flow of electricity. Why do we need it? 🤔</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> LEDs are delicate! If too much electricity flows through them, they will burn out. A resistor limits the current, protecting the LED. 🔥🚫</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Resistors can also be used to control how much electricity goes to different parts of a circuit. ⚙️</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Resistors have colored bands that tell you their value (how much they resist). We'll usually use common values like 220 Ohm or 330 Ohm for LEDs. 🌈</p>

            <p><strong>Connection to Programming:</strong> When we program a microcontroller to turn an LED on or off, we're essentially telling it to complete or break a circuit path through its output pins. Understanding these basic electronic components is crucial for building physical computing projects. 💻🔌</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">How Computers Understand the World! 🌎🧠</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Digital, Analog, and Sensors 0️⃣1️⃣〰️</h3>
            <p>When microcontrollers interact with the world, they use different types of signals. Today, we'll learn about <strong>Digital</strong> and <strong>Analog</strong> signals, and how <strong>Sensors</strong> use them to gather information. 📡</p>

            <h4>Digital Signals 0️⃣1️⃣</h4>
            <p>Digital signals are like an "on" or "off" switch. They have only two possible states: HIGH (on, 1, 5 Volts) or LOW (off, 0, 0 Volts). Think of a light switch: it's either on or off, no in-between. 💡开关</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> A button press (pressed/not pressed) <span class="emoji">🔘</span>, a door sensor (open/closed) <span class="emoji">🚪</span>, an LED (on/off) <span class="emoji">💡</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Microcontroller Pins:</strong> Many pins on a microcontroller are "digital pins" that can read or send digital signals. 📍</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Analog Signals 〰️</h4>
            <p>Analog signals are continuous, meaning they can have a wide range of values, not just two. Think of a dimmer switch for a light: you can make the light brighter or dimmer gradually. 💡调光器</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Temperature (can be 20.1°C, 20.2°C, etc.) <span class="emoji">🌡️</span>, light intensity (not just dark/light, but shades in between) <span class="emoji">☀️</span>, sound volume <span class="emoji">🔊</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Microcontroller Pins:</strong> Some pins are "analog pins" that can read these varying signals. Microcontrollers convert analog signals into digital numbers so they can process them. 🔢</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Digital is like a "boolean" (True/False) in C or a "touching?" block in Scratch. Analog is like a "variable" that can hold many different numbers, similar to a "distance to mouse-pointer" block giving a range of values. 🤝</p>

            <h4>Sensors 👁️‍🗨️👂</h4>
            <p>Sensors are devices that detect and respond to events or changes in the physical environment. They convert physical phenomena (like light, temperature, pressure) into electrical signals that a microcontroller can read. 📡</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Sensors:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emoji">👆</span> <strong>Button:</strong> Sends HIGH when pressed, LOW when not.</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji">🚶‍♂️</span> <strong>Motion Sensor (PIR):</strong> Sends HIGH when motion is detected, LOW when not.</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji">🧲</span> <strong>Reed Switch:</strong> Sends HIGH/LOW based on a magnet's presence (e.g., for door open/closed).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Analog Sensors:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emoji">☀️</span> <strong>Light Sensor (Photoresistor/LDR):</strong> Resistance changes with light, giving a range of voltage values.</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji">🌡️</span> <strong>Temperature Sensor (Thermistor):</strong> Resistance changes with temperature, giving a range of voltage values.</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji"> knob</span> <strong>Potentiometer (Knob):</strong> Changes resistance as you turn it, giving a range of voltage values.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Sensors are the "eyes" and "ears" of our smart devices and robots. They provide the input data that our microcontroller's code (using loops and conditionals) will process to make decisions and control outputs. 🧠</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Things Happen in the Real World! 💪🔊💡</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Actuators ⚙️</h3>
            <p>Yesterday, we learned about sensors, which are the inputs for our microcontroller. Today, we'll focus on <strong>Actuators</strong>, which are the outputs! Actuators are devices that take an electrical signal from a microcontroller and convert it into a physical action (light, sound, motion). ⚡➡️ physicality</p>

            <h4>What are Actuators? 🛠️</h4>
            <p>An actuator is a component that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It acts upon an environment by converting a control signal (from a microcontroller) into a physical phenomenon such as motion, light, or sound. ⚙️</p>
            <p><strong>Think of them as:</strong> The "muscles" or "voices" of your smart devices and robots. 💪🗣️</p>

            <h4>Common Actuators:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">💡</span> <strong>LED (Light Emitting Diode):</strong> We've seen this! It lights up when current flows through it. A digital output (HIGH/LOW) can turn it on/off. Analog signals (using a technique called PWM - Pulse Width Modulation) can control its brightness. 💡</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🔊</span> <strong>Buzzer:</strong> Produces sound. A digital output can turn it on/off for a simple beep. More advanced buzzers or speakers can play different tones or melodies with varying signals. 🎶</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">⚙️</span> <strong>Motor:</strong> Creates motion.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emoji">🌀</span> <strong>DC Motor:</strong> Spins continuously in one direction when power is applied. Reversing polarity reverses direction. Digital outputs can turn it on/off.</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji">📐</span> <strong>Servo Motor:</strong> Can move to a specific angle (e.g., 0 to 180 degrees). Used for precise movements like opening a door or pointing a camera. Needs special signals from the microcontroller.</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji">👣</span> <strong>Stepper Motor:</strong> Can move in very precise steps, allowing for exact positioning and control.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="emoji"> relay</span> <strong>Relay:</strong> An electronically controlled switch. Used to turn on/off larger electrical devices (like a lamp or fan) that require more power than the microcontroller can directly supply. 🔌</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Connection to Programming:</strong> Actuators are controlled by the output pins of our microcontroller. Our code (using `if/else` statements and loops) will decide when and how to send signals to these actuators, making our physical projects respond to inputs and perform tasks. This is like the "move" or "say" blocks in Scratch, but in the real world! 💻➡️ physicality</p>

            <p>The structure of a program for a microcontroller often looks very similar to the C programs you've been writing, but with special commands (functions) that interact with the pins.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>// Imagine this is C code for an Arduino microcontroller

// --- Setup Phase (like 'when green flag clicked' or initialization) ---
void setup() {
  // Set up an LED connected to digital pin 13 as an OUTPUT
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Tells Arduino pin 13 will send signals out

  // Set up a button connected to digital pin 2 as an INPUT with internal pull-up
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP); // Tells Arduino pin 2 will read signals in
  
  // Start serial communication (like printf for debugging)
  Serial.begin(9600); // Opens a communication channel to your computer
}

// --- Loop Phase (like 'forever' loop) ---
void loop() { // Keep doing this forever
    // Read the button state (INPUT)
    // If using INPUT_PULLUP, buttonState will be LOW when pressed, HIGH when not pressed.
    int buttonState = digitalRead(2); // Read the state of pin 2

    // If button is pressed (value is LOW)
    if (buttonState == LOW) {
        digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn LED ON (OUTPUT) - Send a HIGH signal
        Serial.println("Button pressed, LED ON!"); // Print message to Serial Monitor
    } else { // If button is not pressed (HIGH)
        digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // Turn LED OFF (OUTPUT) - Send a LOW signal
        Serial.println("Button not pressed, LED OFF.");
    }

    delay(100); // Wait a little bit before checking again (like 'wait 0.1 secs' in Scratch)
}
</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Notice the Connections:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>`void setup()`: Like the initial setup in Scratch (`when green flag clicked`).</li>
                <li>`void loop()`: Our familiar "forever" loop.</li>
                <li>`pinMode(pin, mode)`: Setting up pins, like telling Scratch a sprite is ready to move or sense.</li>
                <li>`digitalRead(pin)`: Our "sensing" input, like Scratch's `key pressed?` or C's `scanf()`.</li>
                <li>`digitalWrite(pin, value)`: Our "action" output, like Scratch's `move steps` or C's `printf()`, but now it's turning a physical LED on/off!</li>
                <li>`delay(milliseconds)`: Just like Scratch's `wait () seconds`.</li>
                <li>`Serial.begin()` / `Serial.println()`: For debugging, similar to `printf()` in C or `print()` in Python.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Your First Hardware Program: Making an LED Blink! 💡💻</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Arduino C++ Basics & Blink ✨</h3>
            <p>Today, we'll write our first actual code for a microcontroller in Tinkercad Circuits! We'll use a simplified version of C++ (the language Arduino uses) to make an LED blink. This is the "Hello, World!" of hardware programming! 👋</p>

            <h4>Arduino Program Structure (C++) ⚙️</h4>
            <p>Every Arduino program has two main parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>void setup() { ... }</code>: This code runs only once when the Arduino first turns on or resets. It's used for setting up pins (input/output) and starting initial values. (Like <code>when green flag clicked</code> and initial variable setup in Scratch). 🚀</li>
                <li><code>void loop() { ... }</code>: This code runs repeatedly, forever. This is where your main program logic goes. (Like the <code>forever</code> loop in Scratch). ♾️</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Arduino Commands: 🔑</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>pinMode(pinNumber, mode);</code>: Tells the Arduino whether a specific pin will be used as an <code>INPUT</code> or an <code>OUTPUT</code>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>pinNumber</code>: The number of the pin you're using (e.g., 13). 🔢</li>
                        <li><code>mode</code>: <code>INPUT</code> or <code>OUTPUT</code>. ➡️⬅️</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set pin 13 as an output
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><code>digitalWrite(pinNumber, value);</code>: Sends a digital signal (HIGH or LOW) to an output pin.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>pinNumber</code>: The pin you're controlling. 📍</li>
                        <li><code>value</code>: <code>HIGH</code> (turns it on, 5V) or <code>LOW</code> (turns it off, 0V). 💡❌</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn LED on
digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // Turn LED off
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><code>delay(milliseconds);</code>: Pauses the program for a specified number of milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second). (Like <code>wait () seconds</code> in Scratch). ⏳</li>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Blink Code Example: 💡✨</h4>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>// This code makes an LED connected to digital pin 13 blink on and off.

void setup() {
  // Initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// The loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // Wait for a second
}
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> The `setup()` function is like the initial setup in Scratch (`when green flag clicked`). The `loop()` function is your `forever` loop. `digitalWrite()` is your action block, and `delay()` is your wait block. You're using familiar logic, just with new words! 🧠</p>

            <h3>Lesson Notes: Digital Input with Buttons 🔘</h3>
            <p>Yesterday, we made an LED blink. Today, we'll make our circuit interactive by reading input from a <strong>Push Button</strong>. This is where our `if/else` logic becomes very powerful in the physical world! 💪</p>

            <h4>Connecting a Push Button 🔌</h4>
            <p>A push button is a simple digital sensor. When you press it, it completes a circuit. When you release it, it breaks the circuit. To connect it to an Arduino, we usually need a "pull-down" or "pull-up" resistor to make sure the pin has a clear HIGH or LOW state when the button is not pressed. 🛡️</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pull-up Resistor:</strong> Connects the input pin to 5V. When the button is NOT pressed, the pin reads HIGH. When pressed, it connects to GND, so the pin reads LOW. (This is common with Arduino's internal pull-up). ⬆️⬇️</li>
                <li><strong>Pull-down Resistor:</strong> Connects the input pin to GND. When the button is NOT pressed, the pin reads LOW. When pressed, it connects to 5V, so the pin reads HIGH. ⬇️⬆️</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For simplicity in Tinkercad, we can often just connect one side of the button to a digital pin and the other to GND, and use Arduino's internal pull-up resistor feature.  simplifies</p>

            <h4>Key Arduino Commands for Input: 🔑📥</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>pinMode(pinNumber, mode);</code>: Still used, but now <code>mode</code> will be <code>INPUT</code> or <code>INPUT_PULLUP</code>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>INPUT</code>: Requires an external pull-down resistor. ⬇️</li>
                        <li><code>INPUT_PULLUP</code>: Uses Arduino's built-in pull-up resistor, simplifies wiring. (Pin reads HIGH when button is open, LOW when pressed). ⬆️</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP); // Set pin 2 as an input with internal pull-up
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><code>digitalRead(pinNumber);</code>: Reads the digital state (HIGH or LOW) of an input pin. It returns <code>HIGH</code> or <code>LOW</code>.
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>int buttonState = digitalRead(2); // Read the state of pin 2
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Button Read Example: 🔘💻</h4>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>// This code reads the state of a button and prints it to the Serial Monitor.

int buttonPin = 2; // The digital pin the button is connected to

void setup() {
  // Initialize the button pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor.
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  // Start serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the state of the button
  // If using INPUT_PULLUP, buttonState will be LOW when pressed, HIGH when not pressed.
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // Print the button state to the Serial Monitor
  if (buttonState == LOW) { // If button is pressed (LOW)
    Serial.println("Button is pressed!");
  } else { // If button is not pressed (HIGH)
    Serial.println("Button is NOT pressed.");
  }

  delay(100); // Small delay to prevent too many readings
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Serial Monitor:</strong> In Tinkercad, click the "Serial Monitor" button at the bottom of the code editor to see the messages printed by <code>Serial.println()</code>. This is like your C `printf()` output! 💬</p>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Reading a button is exactly like using a "key pressed?" or "mouse down?" sensing block in Scratch, or `scanf()` in C that returns a specific value. We then use `if/else` to make decisions based on that input, just like we practiced! 🤝</p>

                <p><strong>Hint:</strong> You might need to add a small delay and a way to prevent the count from increasing multiple times if the button is held down (we'll cover "debouncing" later, but for now, a simple delay after incrementing is fine). ⏳</p>

        <!-- Day 25 -->
        <div class="slide" id="slide-25">
            <div class="day-header">Day 25: Combining Input & Output: Button Controls LED (Simulator)</div>
            <h2 class="slide-title">Your First Interactive Hardware Project! 💡👆</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Input-Output Integration 🤝</h3>
            <p>Today is a milestone! We'll combine our knowledge of reading button inputs and controlling LED outputs to create a truly interactive circuit. When you press the button, the LED will turn on, and when you release it, the LED will turn off. This is the core of many smart devices! 🎮</p>

            <h4>Circuit Setup: Button and LED 🔌💡🔘</h4>
            <p>You'll need both an LED (with its resistor) and a push button connected to your Arduino in Tinkercad. Make sure they are connected to different digital pins. 📍</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LED:</strong> Anode (long leg) to a digital pin (e.g., Pin 13), Cathode (short leg) through a 220 Ohm resistor to GND. 💡🛡️</li>
                <li><strong>Button:</strong> One leg to a digital pin (e.g., Pin 2), the other leg to GND. (We'll use `INPUT_PULLUP` for the button pin). 🔘🔌</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Combined Code Logic: 💻</h4>
            <p>The logic is simple: In our `loop()`, we'll constantly read the button's state. If the button is pressed (LOW), we'll set the LED pin to HIGH. If the button is not pressed (HIGH), we'll set the LED pin to LOW. 🔄</p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>// This code turns an LED on when a button is pressed, and off when released.

int buttonPin = 2;  // The digital pin the button is connected to
int ledPin = 13;    // The digital pin the LED is connected to

void setup() {
  // Set up the button pin as an input with internal pull-up.
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  // Set up the LED pin as an output.
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

  // Start serial communication (optional, for debugging)
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the state of the button
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // If the button is pressed (LOW, because of INPUT_PULLUP)
  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
    Serial.println("Button pressed: LED ON");
  } else { // If the button is not pressed (HIGH)
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn LED OFF
    Serial.println("Button not pressed: LED OFF");
  }

  delay(50); // Small delay to prevent rapid flickering/readings
}
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> This project is a direct translation of the `if/else` logic you mastered in Scratch and C, but now it's controlling physical components! The `digitalRead()` is your "sensing" input, and `digitalWrite()` is your "action" output, all controlled by your conditional logic within a continuous loop. 🌉</p>

Intentionally introduce a "bug" (e.g., reverse the LED connections, forget the resistor, change `HIGH` to `LOW` in the `if` statement). Then, switch with another pair and try to find and fix their bug. Discuss strategies for debugging circuits and code. 🔍🛠️</p>

                <p><strong>Hint:</strong> You'll need a `delay()` inside your `if` block. ⏳</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Measuring the World: Distance, Light, and More! 📏☀️</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Analog Sensors and Ultrasonic 〰️🔊</h3>
            <p>So far, we've mostly dealt with digital signals (on/off). Today, we'll introduce <strong>Analog Sensors</strong>, which give us a range of values, allowing our devices to measure things like distance, light levels, or temperature. We'll focus conceptually on the <strong>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</strong>. 📊</p>

            <h4>Analog Sensor Recap 🧠</h4>
            <p>Remember, analog signals are continuous. Microcontrollers have special "Analog Input" pins that can read these varying voltages and convert them into numbers (e.g., 0-1023 for Arduino). This number represents the strength of the signal. 🔢</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">☀️</span> <strong>Light Sensor (Photoresistor/LDR):</strong> The resistance changes with light. We read a voltage that varies with brightness.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🌡️</span> <strong>Temperature Sensor (Thermistor):</strong> Resistance changes with temperature. We read a voltage that varies with heat.</li>
                <li><span class="emoji"> knob</span> <strong>Potentiometer (Knob):</strong> A variable resistor. Turning the knob changes the resistance, and thus the voltage read by the analog pin.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) - Conceptual 📏🔊</h4>
            <p>This is a fantastic sensor for robotics and IoT! It measures distance by sending out a high-frequency sound wave (ultrasound) and listening for the echo. The time it takes for the sound to return tells us how far away an object is. 🤖💡</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The sensor sends out a short burst of ultrasound (the "trigger"). 🔊</li>
                        <li>The sound travels, hits an object, and bounces back (the "echo"). ↩️</li>
                        <li>The sensor measures the time between sending the sound and receiving the echo. ⏱️</li>
                        <li>Since we know the speed of sound, we can calculate the distance: <code>Distance = (Time * Speed of Sound) / 2</code> (divide by 2 because the sound travels there and back). ➕➖✖️➗</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pins:</strong> Typically has 4 pins: VCC (power), GND (ground), Trig (trigger), Echo (echo). 🔌</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The Echo pin produces a pulse whose duration (length of time it's HIGH) is proportional to the distance. We use special Arduino functions to measure this pulse duration. 📊</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection to Programming:</strong> Reading an analog sensor or an ultrasonic sensor is more complex than a simple button, but it still uses the same core programming logic. We read a number (distance, light level), store it in a variable, and then use `if/else` statements to make decisions based on that number (e.g., "IF distance < 10cm THEN stop motor"). 🧠</p>

                <h4>Peer Learning Activity: Sensor Application Ideas 💡🤝</h4>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> In pairs, brainstorm 2-3 creative ways you could use an ultrasonic distance sensor in a smart device or robot. For each idea, describe what the device would be, what problem it solves, and how the distance information would be used in the code (e.g., "If distance is less than X, do Y"). ✍️</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Think critically about how analog data can be used to control actions. 🎯</p>

                    <li>Reads the light sensor value. 📥</li>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Making Sense of Sensor Data! 📊🧠</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Data Visualization 📈</h3>
            <p>When our smart devices collect data (like temperature, light, or distance), it's often just a stream of numbers. To truly understand this data, we need to visualize it! Today, we'll explore the concept of <strong>Data Visualization</strong> and how we can represent sensor data using simple charts, conceptually linking it back to C. 🔢➡️🖼️</p>

            <h4>What is Data Visualization? 🤔</h4>
            <p>Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. 🗺️</p>
            <p><strong>Why is it important for IoT?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji">📈</span> <strong>Understanding Trends:</strong> Is the temperature in your room slowly rising or falling over time?</li>
                <li><span class="emoji">🚨</span> <strong>Spotting Problems:</strong> Is a sensor suddenly giving strange readings?</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Simple Visualization Concepts: 📊</h4>
            <p>Even without fancy tools, we can think about how to visualize data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emoji"> bar_chart</span> <strong>Bar Charts:</strong> Good for comparing discrete categories (e.g., number of button presses per hour).</li>
                <li><span class="emoji"> line_chart</span> <strong>Line Graphs:</strong> Excellent for showing changes over time (e.g., temperature readings throughout the day).</li>
                <li><span class="emoji"> scatter_plot</span> <strong>Scatter Plots:</strong> Good for showing relationships between two different measurements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Conceptual C for Data Display: 💻</h4>
            <p>While we won't build full graphical charts, we can use C's `printf()` function to create very simple text-based visualizations or prepare data for charting.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>// Imagine this is C code receiving temperature data from a sensor
// We'll use an array to simulate collecting data over time

    int temperatures[] = {22, 23, 22, 24, 25, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22}; // Example readings

        int temp = temperatures[i];
        // Create a bar using '*' characters, scaled by temperature
        // Adjust 20 to your desired base for scaling
        for (int j = 0; j < (temp - 20); j++) {
            printf("*");
        }

    float avg_temp = (float)sum_temp / num_readings;

    printf("\nHighest Temperature: %i°C\n", max_temp);
    printf("Lowest Temperature: %i°C\n", min_temp);
    printf("Average Temperature: %.2f°C\n", avg_temp); // .2f means 2 decimal places

    return 0;

            <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Data visualization combines your knowledge of variables (to store data), arrays/lists (to store collections of data over time), loops (to process each data point), and operators (to find averages, min/max). It's about taking raw numbers from sensors and making them meaningful for humans. 🧠</p>

            <h2 class="slide-title">Your Interactive Smart Home! 🏠💡</h2>
            <h3>Lesson Notes: Integrated Project Building 🛠️</h3>
            <p>Today, you'll bring together everything you've learned about electronics, sensors, actuators, and programming logic to build a "Smart Home" simulation in Tinkercad Circuits. This project will combine multiple inputs and outputs, controlled by your Arduino C++ code. 💻🔌</p>

            <h4>Project Goal: Smart Home Simulation 🎯</h4>
            <p>Design and build a small "smart home" system in Tinkercad Circuits. It should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least <strong>two different types of inputs (sensors/buttons)</strong>. Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emoji">🔘</span> Push button (digital input)</li>
                        <li><span class="emoji">☀️</span> Photoresistor (light sensor - analog input)</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>At least <strong>two different types of outputs (actuators)</strong>. Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emoji">💡</span> LED (digital output, or analog for brightness)</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your Arduino code must use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>`setup()` and `loop()`. ⚙️♾️</li>
                        <li>`pinMode()` for all pins. 📍</li>
                        <li>`digitalRead()` or `analogRead()` for inputs. 📥</li>
                        <li>`digitalWrite()` or `analogWrite()` (for PWM, e.g., LED brightness) for outputs. 📤</li>
                        <li>`if/else` statements for decision-making. ⚖️</li>
                        <li>`delay()` for timing. ⏳</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The inputs should logically control the outputs (e.g., "If light is low, turn on LED"). 🧠</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Project Ideas (Choose one or create your own): 💡</h4>
